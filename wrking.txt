            after read humidity
            after read temp

            after hif
            WS Message: {"message": "Forbidden",    "connectionId":"TksoscSsoAMCKFA=", "requestId":"TktcPG_zoAMFsew="}
            before contains type


getGPS does not works: WS disconnects on esp32 end and then connects
